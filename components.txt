Components to be implemented
============================


Audio
-----

For obvious reasons an audio engine is required. It should be implemented on
linux (unix), windows and possibly other operating systems. A simple system to
be able to have separate audio streams, each with their own source is vital.


CPU Emulator
------------

To be able to operate a ship one needs an operating system. This does not
necessarily need to be an actual OS, but some form of system to control
and steer a ship is required. This system should be able to vary wildly,
for example one might start with a junkyard ship with shitty control. At a
later stage in the game it might be fully upgraded to an advanced ship with
a terminal or even full operating system.


Graphics
--------

For seriously obvious reasons a graphics engine is required. This engine should
support 3D graphics implemented on unix, windows and possibly other operating
systems. It should be capable of harvasting modern GPUs and drivers, as well as
a decent amount of older GPUs so most gaming desktops will be able to run it.
The engine will be Groufix.


Networking
----------

For a multiplayer component networking is required. This could entail a peer to
peer setup or a client/server model. It should handle communication between
devices in a fast and efficient manner, not everywhere is it required to have a
reliable connection.


Physics
-------

A game set in space will need physics. Physics to simulate space. Physics to
simulate being on a planet. Physics to simulate being in a spaceship. Spaceship
physics, particle physics, lots of physics. A physics engine is required that
should handle physics in a generic way.
